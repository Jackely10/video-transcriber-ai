1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
My bike is stolen.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,760
My bike is gone.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:27,260
I'm just going to go for it.

4
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,260
Frankie is stolen.

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:38,450
Frankie is stolen.

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,450
I walk outside.

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,170
Only the bike cover is still there.

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
Frankie is gone.

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:51,780
But I have airtags.

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,380
My bike is stolen.

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,340
My bike is gone.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
It is here.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,340
It's not far.

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,340
I have airtags on it.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
I was the goal.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,340
That's telephone from the police.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,340
You are police?

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,340
No.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,340
You're not police.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
No, not police.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,340
I can't be telephone with you.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
It's moving.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
It's moving.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,340
I was also talking about it.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
It's a seara road.

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:35,300
So let me just get the key but looks like Frankie is moving.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,780
Just so you know you cannot start Frankie right now without the key.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,420
People thought that from the videos it's only when you rewire with the second wiring

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,980
room that you can start a bike without the key but right now it's not possible

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:02:04,420
so that's not how they got her. I think I should go with police. Maybe not alone. I don't know.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:12,410
She's not far she's not far but now I have two notifications I have two airtags in her.

32
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,370
I think one is not updating but it means they're moving.

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,350
I don't know, I don't know.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,350
I don't know.

35
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,350
But where is the police coming or?

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Yes.

37
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,350
I'm going to go look for it now.

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,350
I'm not going to wait here.

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,350
I'm going to go look.

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,350
I'm not going to stand here and wait.

41
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,350
I'm going to go look for the police.

42
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,350
Yeah.

43
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,350
I want to go look for my motorbike.

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,350
I want to go look for my motorbike, I know where it is

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,350
I just want to go to the police

46
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,350
Yeah but I am waiting and if they remove the tag I don't know where it is anymore

47
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,350
Do you have a car?

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes, it's here

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,350
But you have two tags

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,350
One tag? Two tags

51
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,350
So they already removed one tag

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,350
See it's two different locations

53
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,350
I call the manager

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,350
I don't want to go to the police.

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,350
No, I don't want to go to the police.

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,350
Or I go alone.

57
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,350
But I think it's better with the police, but they're not doing anything.

58
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,820
It's either here or here.

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,820
But they are moving it, I think.

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:44,950
Or I don't know.

61
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,950
It's here all the way.

62
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,950
Yes.

63
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,510
I don't have any money on me.

64
00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:01,320
I think it's next.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,740
Any police coming or not?

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
No, no.

67
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Police.

68
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Just where you know about it.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
I think it's on the...

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
It's on the...

71
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
It's there

72
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
There's a motorbike I think

73
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
On the other side, I'll not wait

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:47,700
For a place

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Yeah, I'm afraid

76
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Here?

77
00:04:51,700 --> 00:05:18,310
It's somewhere here

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,620
In the number police column

79
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah, I can play a sound

80
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,280
But if it's inside then you won't hear it I think

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:59,510
It's somewhere inside then

82
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,510
Inside and...

83
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,510
Where did it just come from?

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,080
That wasn't there before

85
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:18,900
Someone put some put my backpack. Can you believe that put this bike there?

86
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:33,350
We'll put this back there

87
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:42,430
Someone put it back. I swear oh frankly, what do they do?

88
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,430
What what is this?

89
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:53,780
They somehow carried her they broke my mirror. Can you believe that?

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Oh, they didn't break it. Okay

91
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:06,340
See they put this it wasn't there right?

92
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:15,800
They give it out of nowhere.

93
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
So the thieves must be somewhere here.

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
And saw me coming look for it.

95
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
She seems fine.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
They didn't even take any of my stuff.

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
They dropped, maybe they dropped it.

98
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:53,140
They destroyed this.

99
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,690
This is supposed to...

100
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,690
They never drive it.

101
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,690
Because this...

102
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:38,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

103
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,920
I thought I was going to go in.

104
00:08:39,920 --> 00:09:12,640
This is my ride.

105
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
Yeah, here's the ears fine.

106
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah.

107
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,060
OK.

108
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,780
OK, a small update.

109
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,220
I am now walking.

110
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,500
I just went back to the hotel.

111
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,860
Frankie is safe now with that shop owner.

112
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,580
I went back to the hotel to get a few tools

113
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,020
and to grab my helmet just in case if I manage to fix Frankie,

114
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,060
I can write her back to the hotel

115
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,900
but it's very chaotic

116
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm trying to film it as I go but it's a little bit hard

117
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm still kind of a little bit shocked what happened

118
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,660
but the story has become more clear

119
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,380
because there's camera footage everywhere

120
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,460
first so it's two guys who stole Frankie

121
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,940
they got caught on camera just outside the hotel

122
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,280
We are at the shop right now.

123
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes, we are at the shop.

124
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
We are not going to the shop.

125
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,880
did that maybe trying to get her started there something anyway so they were

126
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,080
pulling Frankie with this motorbike so one guy on Frankie one guy on the other

127
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,420
motorbike that was all caught on the security cameras of the shop the shop owner

128
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,960
super nice he showed me but he told me that I couldn't film that because that's

129
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,080
against the law so only like the police can see that there's something I don't

130
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:12,660
know but he showed me and it was so clear to see so they came the one motorbike

131
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,680
pulling Frankie and then they fell so that's why my mirror got all banked up so

132
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,720
they fell on the left side then picked up Frankie and a bandit there they put

133
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,240
her back up put her on the side stand and then left the bedcocks were still

134
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,160
closed so that's why first I thought if they somehow minutes together started

135
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,440
which I don't think they would have but anyway then maybe that's why they didn't

136
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,960
get very far because they ran out of fuel because they didn't understand the

137
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,320
pet parks but that was never the case they never got her started they were just

138
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,160
pulling her but then yeah they caught all the wires so I should be able to switch

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,800
to the second wiring, wiring room unless they also caught that one that I don't

140
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,160
know and then ultimately Frankie should always be able to start but then I just don't have any lights so

141
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,160
eventually that needs to be fixed then because I can't really go around writing without any lights

142
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,800
on but anyway and now I'm just going back and see what I can do

143
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,240
they didn't take anything else because I still had like a few bags on the bike with like

144
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,720
non-essential stuff that I don't feel like dragging up and down hotel rooms every

145
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,760
single day so it's like nothing of value and yeah they didn't take anything on

146
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,840
the security footage you could see one guy he wanted I had like a dirty air

147
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,960
filter and one of the side bags and he pulled that out looked at it stuff the back

148
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:58,200
in and then they left and in the shop they told me that the police can

149
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,760
there's cameras everywhere here so the camera that I watched was from the shop

150
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,400
but the police also have cameras everywhere so yeah they could trace them

151
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:18,720
exactly like where they went okay here she's now let's get to work okay here you

152
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,880
can see the bit better but they just cut this main cable the number of wires that are cut

153
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:41,540
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14 wires.

154
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,540
They got 14 wires.

155
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
Okay, they didn't go under the seat.

156
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,540
This looks all normal.

157
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Okay, this also looks all normal.

158
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:05,540
I didn't cut anything here. That's good. So all I need to do now right is to swap yellow

159
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:23,190
and green with yellow and green here. Okay step one I've done so I've swapped these

160
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,230
ones. Now I need to swap one wire which is on the new thing so I have to take off the gas

161
00:14:29,230 --> 00:16:29,760
tank again. I think I can fix it. Thank you. These are my new friends. What's your name?

162
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,400
We still have a diamond in the bottom of the gate.

163
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,200
And?

164
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,400
The ball is good.

165
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
From Scotland.

166
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
That is Glasgow.

167
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Glasgow?

168
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,190
Yeah.

169
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,870
And they came all the way to help me from like a village, far away.

170
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,870
Green village.

171
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,870
Green village.

172
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,950
And now they even brought me food.

173
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,350
Yeah, we want to make sure you have a place to live.

174
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
Thank you so much.

175
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,910
Yeah, we are everywhere for everybody.

176
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,310
Yeah.

177
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,790
So nice.

178
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,510
OK, so now I've clean up all the water.

179
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:08,210
wires so these ones are swapped, this one is swapped and then the one underneath tank.

180
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,730
Not only problem is to switch the bike off.

181
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,750
I can't switch it off anymore because none of the electric work now so now I can start

182
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,650
the bike without the key and this obviously doesn't do anything anymore.

183
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:30,970
So now the only way to switch off the bike is unplugging this but yeah we're gonna

184
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,690
forget it with Moritz I'm gonna try and find another solution but for now this is how

185
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,690
I'm gonna do it.

186
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:49,720
I just need to see if I can somehow do it so I can reach it a bit easier without having

187
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,920
to take the seat off every time.

188
00:17:52,920 --> 00:19:02,470
Okay so I did it.

189
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,230
Switching 4 cables right.

190
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:13,550
Now Frankie is starting, Frankie is riding without a key, without a kill switch, no electricity,

191
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:21,070
no lights, nothing, but at least I can get away and I can go back to the hotel.

192
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,390
Anyway, I don't think on any other bike it would not have been possible to now just ride

193
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,390
away.

194
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,550
So I'm just obviously eternally grateful for Molleaks' clever plan to make this.

195
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,270
I honestly never thought it would ever be necessary.

196
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,110
But there you go.

197
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,790
Um, yeah I'm just going back to the hotel now and then probably the game plan.

198
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,030
Okay, I don't know what I did but I didn't connect my microphone properly to my home with

199
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,030
camera.

200
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,030
I'm sorry.

201
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,030
So I don't have any audio.

202
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,950
Anyway, I am startled back now.

203
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,110
I kicked it and it started immediately on the first gig.

204
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,110
Super happy.

205
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,510
I'm riding back to the hotel and then as I tried to shift gear, I noticed that.

206
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:08,910
My gear shifter is bent again, I have to be also from when they dropped frankly on the left side.

207
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:15,710
So my gear shifter is bent and my clutch lever is also in a weight position because all of that kind of moved.

208
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,390
And I noticed that my range act is gone.

209
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,670
Remember my range act is which is kind of stuffed in between in the front.

210
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,830
It's gone.

211
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,150
I don't think that it on purpose, I think that they were maybe looking for the dashboard

212
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,110
looking for wires and removed it and that's what I think. Okay I'm back at the hotel and

213
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:45,070
remember I can't switch off the motorbike because no key and no kill switch. So all I can do is

214
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:52,190
put it in neutral. So I put it in neutral and then I think it's there's an easier wire to remove.

215
00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:00,670
The one here at the what is that the ignition coil. So I take out the one wire from the ignition coil

216
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:07,230
and then the bike also stops. Now I figured I'm not gonna leave anything up to fade so I'm

217
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,590
taking off all my bags now because I'm gonna stay another night in the hotel. I'm not really

218
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,830
up to leaving now so I'm taking off all my stuff, put the motorcycle cover back on, put it on an

219
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:37,950
extra lock and then hopefully for the fine foot tonight. So I am back at the hotel. A couple of things

220
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:44,190
I think I need to set straight. So first of all this morning when I thought that the bike was moving

221
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,790
because the two airtags were at two different places was just because it wasn't properly updating or

222
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,590
maybe it was because it was in between buildings that the location was a little bit off because in

223
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:01,150
yet when I got there the bike was all intact. The bike was never moving at the moment that I start

224
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:07,230
looking at it on the airtag. They already left, left her there and then the second thing is I was

225
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,470
convinced this morning that that Frankie wasn't there yet when we arrived and

226
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,990
that suddenly she was there which was also not the case they are already a band

227
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,390
and they're like yeah about 6.30 in the morning and I got there at probably 8.30

228
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,390
or something so Frankie was already there for two hours and I could yeah when I saw

229
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,670
the CCTV footage from the shop I was like oh she was there there was only just a

230
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,870
car parked in front. So that's why we didn't like the guy who helped me this morning.

231
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,150
By the way, I have no idea who he was. He didn't work at the hotel. I think he was a guest

232
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,630
in the hotel or anyway. He was kind enough to walk with me, which I thought in the end was

233
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,110
pretty nice because later I was thinking like, yeah, what if the guys who stole Frankie were still there?

234
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,390
What was I supposed to do on my own? So anyway, I'm glad that he came with me. But anyway,

235
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,150
While we were looking for Frankie, she was all the time just parked there, just hidden behind a car.

236
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,790
And I think when we were like kind of walking around there, the car moved and then suddenly I saw

237
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:17,590
Frankie. So that mystery is also solved. All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.

238
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,430
The unfortunate thing is because they cut 40 wires. They also cut the wire to the electric start,

239
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:30,070
but it's only actually two wires to the electric starter. If I should be able to fix those two

240
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,710
And then at least I have an electric starter again and I don't only have the rely on the kick starter,

241
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,390
that's something I could try.

242
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:42,630
Then step number two is I'm thinking of trying to make to buck that.

243
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,670
You know you've seen in the last video you've seen the motorcycle district here, I could try it here,

244
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,470
but it was circular. I have higher hopes for buck that.

245
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,950
To find a good mechanic there. To fix all the wires, stick them all back together.

246
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,590
Ultimately, I would need a new wiring loom.

247
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,150
Like a completely new wiring loom because fixing why

248
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,670
is back together is not really the best plan and it's just also because I still have a really long way to go.

249
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,310
Like if I was almost there, you would be like, okay, I'm almost there but it's still very far so

250
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:21,190
the best idea is to get an entire new wiring loom but I don't think I'm going to be able to send that to

251
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:30,190
So for Iraq, the plan is I think now try to fix the two wires for the electric start myself.

252
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,190
Then right to Baghdad, try to fix all the other wires.

253
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:39,190
So my original wiring room is kind of fixed and in the meantime organized a new wiring room.

254
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,190
And try to send that to a place where I can properly receive a parcel which is fast and that sort of thing.

255
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,910
and another good mechanic and then yeah change out the entire wiring room so

256
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:57,310
everything works like before so yeah it's crazy right I mean I'm it's

257
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:03,630
unbelievable that I'm so riding the bike that's the advantage of a bike like this

258
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,070
that it's possible to kickstart it and to ride it without any electricity that

259
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,350
would not never have been possible otherwise it's just yeah it's just a shame that

260
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,550
they cut the wires and I was speaking to some guys here and they said they were probably

261
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:22,230
car thieves thinking that that would make them be able to start the bike because ultimately

262
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,030
one mystery that still remains although maybe the police can track this down because as I

263
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,150
said there's cameras everywhere so they can probably track them from the moment they left

264
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,950
the hotel to where I found it by all these cameras everywhere, by anyway.

265
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,030
anyway. Well, I got a little bit of story, sorry, my mind is like all over the place.

266
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,480
Yeah, we think that they thought by cutting the wires, that's how they could start to buy,

267
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,800
which is so stupid, like, that would never work on any motorcycle, right, to cut the wires,

268
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,840
like that, and then think that, you know, the motorbike is going to start, it's so stupid, and

269
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,280
And then I was so unnecessary anyway, really, really bloody stupid.

270
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,480
And then, yeah, also that they fell down and when I was watching that footage in the

271
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,160
shop, it's so sad that I couldn't film it because in a way it was kind of slapstick.

272
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,080
Because you could see them coming, the small motorbike in front, pulling Frankie with another

273
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,400
guy on Frankie.

274
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,000
And then both of them came down in the middle of the street.

275
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then they put Frankie back up.

276
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like why didn't they just abandon Frankie like laying on the floor?

277
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, they had to decency to put her back up

278
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and then you could see they were arguing for a little bit

279
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and then they just left on the one motorbike.

280
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But yeah, so yeah, it was just really stupid.

281
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, what are they trying to achieve?

282
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I don't know, I don't know.

283
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh, I also forgot to say, in the end the police came.

284
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So when I was working on the bike, the police came with one car, three policemen

285
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and they also went into the shop and had a look at the CCTV footage.

286
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,800
TV footage, I don't know if they copied it. They told me they were cursed, the guys in 48 hours.

287
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,760
And I told them like, look, it's not for me, you know, I got my bike back and I'll deal with the wires and everything.

288
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,360
They were like, do you want to come to the police station and make a statement and go to court and everything and I was like, absolutely not.

289
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,520
Ultimately the conclusion was they never managed to ride Frankie. In that sense she's pretty well protected.

290
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,240
So that was today, I didn't get anywhere. My plan was to ride about 300 kilometers today.

291
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,320
It was going to be like the longest day riding in Iraq so far. I was like, let's finally, you know,

292
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,080
get some distance going because I've been traveling pretty slowly so far. But I didn't get anywhere.

293
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,520
So I'm gonna wash my hands again. It was pretty dark. And see if I can talk to

294
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,520
to moor it about how if we can fix those two cables for the electric starter.

295
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,520
If not, I can go with only the kick start.

296
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
I'm glad I've been practicing the kick start so I can do it.

297
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
I'm gonna end this video now.

298
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,520
I'm just gonna say, didn't get anywhere but Frankie is back in my possession

299
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
so I guess a happy ending after all.

300
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
I really hope you like this episode.

301
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Even though it was a weird one.

302
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
If you did please give a big thumbs up.
