00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
My bike is stolen.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.760
My bike is gone.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm just going to go for it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Frankie is stolen.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:38.450
Frankie is stolen.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.450
I walk outside.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.170
Only the bike cover is still there.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.170
Frankie is gone.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.780
But I have airtags.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.380
My bike is stolen.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.340
My bike is gone.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.340
It is here.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340
It's not far.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.340
I have airtags on it.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340
I was the goal.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340
That's telephone from the police.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
You are police?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.340
No.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
You're not police.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340
No, not police.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.340
I can't be telephone with you.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
It's moving.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.340
It's moving.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340
I was also talking about it.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
It's a seara road.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:35.300
So let me just get the key but looks like Frankie is moving.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.780
Just so you know you cannot start Frankie right now without the key.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.420
People thought that from the videos it's only when you rewire with the second wiring

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.980
room that you can start a bike without the key but right now it's not possible

00:01:47.980 --> 00:02:04.420
so that's not how they got her. I think I should go with police. Maybe not alone. I don't know.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.410
She's not far she's not far but now I have two notifications I have two airtags in her.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.370
I think one is not updating but it means they're moving.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.350
I don't know, I don't know.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.350
I don't know.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.350
But where is the police coming or?

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.350
Yes.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.350
I'm going to go look for it now.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.350
I'm not going to wait here.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm going to go look.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.350
I'm not going to stand here and wait.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.350
I'm going to go look for the police.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350
Yeah.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.350
I want to go look for my motorbike.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.350
I want to go look for my motorbike, I know where it is

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.350
I just want to go to the police

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.350
Yeah but I am waiting and if they remove the tag I don't know where it is anymore

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.350
Do you have a car?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.350
Yes, it's here

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.350
But you have two tags

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.350
One tag? Two tags

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.350
So they already removed one tag

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.350
See it's two different locations

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.350
I call the manager

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.350
I don't want to go to the police.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.350
No, I don't want to go to the police.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.350
Or I go alone.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.350
But I think it's better with the police, but they're not doing anything.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.820
It's either here or here.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.820
But they are moving it, I think.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:44.950
Or I don't know.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.950
It's here all the way.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.950
Yes.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.510
I don't have any money on me.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:01.320
I think it's next.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.740
Any police coming or not?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.740
No, no.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.740
Police.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.740
Just where you know about it.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.740
I think it's on the...

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.740
It's on the...

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.740
It's there

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.740
There's a motorbike I think

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.740
On the other side, I'll not wait

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:47.700
For a place

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700
Yeah, I'm afraid

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700
Here?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:18.310
It's somewhere here

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.620
In the number police column

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:30.280
Yeah, I can play a sound

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.280
But if it's inside then you won't hear it I think

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:59.510
It's somewhere inside then

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.510
Inside and...

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.510
Where did it just come from?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.080
That wasn't there before

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:18.900
Someone put some put my backpack. Can you believe that put this bike there?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:33.350
We'll put this back there

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:42.430
Someone put it back. I swear oh frankly, what do they do?

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.430
What what is this?

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:53.780
They somehow carried her they broke my mirror. Can you believe that?

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.900
Oh, they didn't break it. Okay

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:06.340
See they put this it wasn't there right?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:15.800
They give it out of nowhere.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800
So the thieves must be somewhere here.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.800
And saw me coming look for it.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
She seems fine.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800
They didn't even take any of my stuff.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.100
They dropped, maybe they dropped it.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:53.140
They destroyed this.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:58.690
This is supposed to...

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.690
They never drive it.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.690
Because this...

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:38.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.920
I thought I was going to go in.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:09:12.640
This is my ride.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.920
Yeah, here's the ears fine.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920
Yeah.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.060
OK.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.780
OK, a small update.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.220
I am now walking.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.500
I just went back to the hotel.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.860
Frankie is safe now with that shop owner.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.580
I went back to the hotel to get a few tools

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:39.020
and to grab my helmet just in case if I manage to fix Frankie,

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.060
I can write her back to the hotel

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.900
but it's very chaotic

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.340
I'm trying to film it as I go but it's a little bit hard

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.460
I'm still kind of a little bit shocked what happened

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.660
but the story has become more clear

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.380
because there's camera footage everywhere

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.460
first so it's two guys who stole Frankie

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.940
they got caught on camera just outside the hotel

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.280
We are at the shop right now.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.280
Yes, we are at the shop.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.280
We are not going to the shop.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.880
did that maybe trying to get her started there something anyway so they were

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.080
pulling Frankie with this motorbike so one guy on Frankie one guy on the other

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.420
motorbike that was all caught on the security cameras of the shop the shop owner

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.960
super nice he showed me but he told me that I couldn't film that because that's

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.080
against the law so only like the police can see that there's something I don't

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:12.660
know but he showed me and it was so clear to see so they came the one motorbike

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:19.680
pulling Frankie and then they fell so that's why my mirror got all banked up so

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.720
they fell on the left side then picked up Frankie and a bandit there they put

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.240
her back up put her on the side stand and then left the bedcocks were still

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.160
closed so that's why first I thought if they somehow minutes together started

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.440
which I don't think they would have but anyway then maybe that's why they didn't

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.960
get very far because they ran out of fuel because they didn't understand the

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.320
pet parks but that was never the case they never got her started they were just

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.160
pulling her but then yeah they caught all the wires so I should be able to switch

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.800
to the second wiring, wiring room unless they also caught that one that I don't

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.160
know and then ultimately Frankie should always be able to start but then I just don't have any lights so

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.160
eventually that needs to be fixed then because I can't really go around writing without any lights

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.800
on but anyway and now I'm just going back and see what I can do

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.240
they didn't take anything else because I still had like a few bags on the bike with like

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.720
non-essential stuff that I don't feel like dragging up and down hotel rooms every

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.760
single day so it's like nothing of value and yeah they didn't take anything on

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.840
the security footage you could see one guy he wanted I had like a dirty air

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.960
filter and one of the side bags and he pulled that out looked at it stuff the back

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:58.200
in and then they left and in the shop they told me that the police can

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.760
there's cameras everywhere here so the camera that I watched was from the shop

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:09.400
but the police also have cameras everywhere so yeah they could trace them

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:18.720
exactly like where they went okay here she's now let's get to work okay here you

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.880
can see the bit better but they just cut this main cable the number of wires that are cut

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:41.540
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14 wires.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.540
They got 14 wires.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.540
Okay, they didn't go under the seat.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.540
This looks all normal.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.540
Okay, this also looks all normal.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:05.540
I didn't cut anything here. That's good. So all I need to do now right is to swap yellow

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:23.190
and green with yellow and green here. Okay step one I've done so I've swapped these

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:29.230
ones. Now I need to swap one wire which is on the new thing so I have to take off the gas

00:14:29.230 --> 00:16:29.760
tank again. I think I can fix it. Thank you. These are my new friends. What's your name?

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.400
We still have a diamond in the bottom of the gate.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.200
And?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.400
The ball is good.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400
From Scotland.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.600
That is Glasgow.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.400
Glasgow?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.190
Yeah.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.870
And they came all the way to help me from like a village, far away.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.870
Green village.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.870
Green village.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.950
And now they even brought me food.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.350
Yeah, we want to make sure you have a place to live.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.350
Thank you so much.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.910
Yeah, we are everywhere for everybody.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.310
Yeah.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.790
So nice.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.510
OK, so now I've clean up all the water.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:08.210
wires so these ones are swapped, this one is swapped and then the one underneath tank.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.730
Not only problem is to switch the bike off.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.750
I can't switch it off anymore because none of the electric work now so now I can start

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:24.650
the bike without the key and this obviously doesn't do anything anymore.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:30.970
So now the only way to switch off the bike is unplugging this but yeah we're gonna

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:36.690
forget it with Moritz I'm gonna try and find another solution but for now this is how

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.690
I'm gonna do it.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:49.720
I just need to see if I can somehow do it so I can reach it a bit easier without having

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.920
to take the seat off every time.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:19:02.470
Okay so I did it.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.230
Switching 4 cables right.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:13.550
Now Frankie is starting, Frankie is riding without a key, without a kill switch, no electricity,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:21.070
no lights, nothing, but at least I can get away and I can go back to the hotel.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:25.390
Anyway, I don't think on any other bike it would not have been possible to now just ride

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.390
away.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:32.550
So I'm just obviously eternally grateful for Molleaks' clever plan to make this.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.270
I honestly never thought it would ever be necessary.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.110
But there you go.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.790
Um, yeah I'm just going back to the hotel now and then probably the game plan.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:48.030
Okay, I don't know what I did but I didn't connect my microphone properly to my home with

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.030
camera.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.030
I'm sorry.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.030
So I don't have any audio.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.950
Anyway, I am startled back now.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.110
I kicked it and it started immediately on the first gig.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.110
Super happy.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.510
I'm riding back to the hotel and then as I tried to shift gear, I noticed that.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:08.910
My gear shifter is bent again, I have to be also from when they dropped frankly on the left side.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:15.710
So my gear shifter is bent and my clutch lever is also in a weight position because all of that kind of moved.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.390
And I noticed that my range act is gone.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:24.670
Remember my range act is which is kind of stuffed in between in the front.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:25.830
It's gone.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:31.150
I don't think that it on purpose, I think that they were maybe looking for the dashboard

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:36.110
looking for wires and removed it and that's what I think. Okay I'm back at the hotel and

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:45.070
remember I can't switch off the motorbike because no key and no kill switch. So all I can do is

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:52.190
put it in neutral. So I put it in neutral and then I think it's there's an easier wire to remove.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:21:00.670
The one here at the what is that the ignition coil. So I take out the one wire from the ignition coil

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:07.230
and then the bike also stops. Now I figured I'm not gonna leave anything up to fade so I'm

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:12.590
taking off all my bags now because I'm gonna stay another night in the hotel. I'm not really

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:18.830
up to leaving now so I'm taking off all my stuff, put the motorcycle cover back on, put it on an

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:37.950
extra lock and then hopefully for the fine foot tonight. So I am back at the hotel. A couple of things

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:44.190
I think I need to set straight. So first of all this morning when I thought that the bike was moving

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:49.790
because the two airtags were at two different places was just because it wasn't properly updating or

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.590
maybe it was because it was in between buildings that the location was a little bit off because in

00:21:54.590 --> 00:22:01.150
yet when I got there the bike was all intact. The bike was never moving at the moment that I start

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:07.230
looking at it on the airtag. They already left, left her there and then the second thing is I was

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:13.470
convinced this morning that that Frankie wasn't there yet when we arrived and

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:18.990
that suddenly she was there which was also not the case they are already a band

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:24.390
and they're like yeah about 6.30 in the morning and I got there at probably 8.30

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:29.390
or something so Frankie was already there for two hours and I could yeah when I saw

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.670
the CCTV footage from the shop I was like oh she was there there was only just a

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.870
car parked in front. So that's why we didn't like the guy who helped me this morning.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.150
By the way, I have no idea who he was. He didn't work at the hotel. I think he was a guest

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.630
in the hotel or anyway. He was kind enough to walk with me, which I thought in the end was

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:55.110
pretty nice because later I was thinking like, yeah, what if the guys who stole Frankie were still there?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.390
What was I supposed to do on my own? So anyway, I'm glad that he came with me. But anyway,

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:06.150
While we were looking for Frankie, she was all the time just parked there, just hidden behind a car.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.790
And I think when we were like kind of walking around there, the car moved and then suddenly I saw

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:17.590
Frankie. So that mystery is also solved. All the pieces of the puzzle are coming together.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:23.430
The unfortunate thing is because they cut 40 wires. They also cut the wire to the electric start,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:30.070
but it's only actually two wires to the electric starter. If I should be able to fix those two

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.710
And then at least I have an electric starter again and I don't only have the rely on the kick starter,

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.390
that's something I could try.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:42.630
Then step number two is I'm thinking of trying to make to buck that.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.670
You know you've seen in the last video you've seen the motorcycle district here, I could try it here,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.470
but it was circular. I have higher hopes for buck that.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:56.950
To find a good mechanic there. To fix all the wires, stick them all back together.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.590
Ultimately, I would need a new wiring loom.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:04.150
Like a completely new wiring loom because fixing why

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:09.670
is back together is not really the best plan and it's just also because I still have a really long way to go.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.310
Like if I was almost there, you would be like, okay, I'm almost there but it's still very far so

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:21.190
the best idea is to get an entire new wiring loom but I don't think I'm going to be able to send that to

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:30.190
So for Iraq, the plan is I think now try to fix the two wires for the electric start myself.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.190
Then right to Baghdad, try to fix all the other wires.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:39.190
So my original wiring room is kind of fixed and in the meantime organized a new wiring room.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:45.190
And try to send that to a place where I can properly receive a parcel which is fast and that sort of thing.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.910
and another good mechanic and then yeah change out the entire wiring room so

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:57.310
everything works like before so yeah it's crazy right I mean I'm it's

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:03.630
unbelievable that I'm so riding the bike that's the advantage of a bike like this

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:08.070
that it's possible to kickstart it and to ride it without any electricity that

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.350
would not never have been possible otherwise it's just yeah it's just a shame that

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.550
they cut the wires and I was speaking to some guys here and they said they were probably

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:22.230
car thieves thinking that that would make them be able to start the bike because ultimately

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:27.030
one mystery that still remains although maybe the police can track this down because as I

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.150
said there's cameras everywhere so they can probably track them from the moment they left

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.950
the hotel to where I found it by all these cameras everywhere, by anyway.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:41.030
anyway. Well, I got a little bit of story, sorry, my mind is like all over the place.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.480
Yeah, we think that they thought by cutting the wires, that's how they could start to buy,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.800
which is so stupid, like, that would never work on any motorcycle, right, to cut the wires,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.840
like that, and then think that, you know, the motorbike is going to start, it's so stupid, and

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.280
And then I was so unnecessary anyway, really, really bloody stupid.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:15.480
And then, yeah, also that they fell down and when I was watching that footage in the

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.160
shop, it's so sad that I couldn't film it because in a way it was kind of slapstick.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.080
Because you could see them coming, the small motorbike in front, pulling Frankie with another

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.400
guy on Frankie.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.000
And then both of them came down in the middle of the street.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And then they put Frankie back up.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Like why didn't they just abandon Frankie like laying on the floor?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
No, they had to decency to put her back up

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
and then you could see they were arguing for a little bit

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
and then they just left on the one motorbike.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
But yeah, so yeah, it was just really stupid.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I mean, what are they trying to achieve?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I don't know, I don't know.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Oh, I also forgot to say, in the end the police came.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
So when I was working on the bike, the police came with one car, three policemen

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
and they also went into the shop and had a look at the CCTV footage.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.800
TV footage, I don't know if they copied it. They told me they were cursed, the guys in 48 hours.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.760
And I told them like, look, it's not for me, you know, I got my bike back and I'll deal with the wires and everything.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:19.360
They were like, do you want to come to the police station and make a statement and go to court and everything and I was like, absolutely not.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.520
Ultimately the conclusion was they never managed to ride Frankie. In that sense she's pretty well protected.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.240
So that was today, I didn't get anywhere. My plan was to ride about 300 kilometers today.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.320
It was going to be like the longest day riding in Iraq so far. I was like, let's finally, you know,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.080
get some distance going because I've been traveling pretty slowly so far. But I didn't get anywhere.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.520
So I'm gonna wash my hands again. It was pretty dark. And see if I can talk to

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:56.520
to moor it about how if we can fix those two cables for the electric starter.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.520
If not, I can go with only the kick start.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.520
I'm glad I've been practicing the kick start so I can do it.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520
I'm gonna end this video now.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.520
I'm just gonna say, didn't get anywhere but Frankie is back in my possession

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.520
so I guess a happy ending after all.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.520
I really hope you like this episode.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.520
Even though it was a weird one.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.520
If you did please give a big thumbs up.
